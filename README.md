# Pixels Schema and Validation

This repository holds the JSON schema and code for validating pixel definitions defined by each of DuckDuckGo's products.

We uses pixels to improve our product and to understand how it is being used. 
Except for cases where users purposefully share sensitive or identifying information with us, such as,
in a breakage report, DuckDuckGo pixels are anonymous.
To learn more about our pixels, visit: https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/atb/

Note: The effort to define our pixels is on-going. Not all our product repositories will contain pixel definitions.

## Setup
A repository that supports pixel definitions will have a folder setup with roughly the following structure:
```
RepoSpecificPixelFolder
    --> pixels [directory that can contain sub-directories with various .json files]
        --> feature1 [directory for pixels related to 'feature1']
            --> interaction_pixels.json
            --> crash_pixels.json
            --> ...
        --> other_pixels.json [file for any pixels that do not belong to a feature folder]
        --> ...
    --> params_dictionary.json [file that defines commonly used parameters]
    --> suffixes_dictionary.json [file that defines commonly used suffixes]
    --> native_experiments.json [file that defines pixels sent by the native experiments framework]
```

You can organize the files and sub-directories within `pixels` however you like, the example above is just one option.

## Documenting a pixel
### Experiment pixels
Pixels sent by the [native experiments framework](https://app.asana.com/1/137249556945/project/1208889145294658/task/1209331148407154?focus=true)
must be documented separately in `native_experiments.json` and adhere to the [native experiments schema](./schemas/native_experiments.schema.json5).

**Fields**:
* `defaultSuffixes`: defines what suffixes are appended to each pixel after the cohort
  * Example: Android appends `.android.[phone|tablet]` to its pixels
  * See [Pixels with dynamic names](#pixels-with-dynamic-names) for more info on how to define these
* `activeExperiments`: defines each experiment with the key being the name of the experiment. Each experiment must also define:
  * `cohorts`: an array of Strings defining each cohort in the experiment
  * `metrics`: a collection of objects where each object is keyed by the metric name as it would appear in the pixel. Each metric must also provide:
    * `description` of the metric
    * `enum` of possible values

**Note**: The following are pre-defined and are automatically taken into account by the pixel schema 
(you do not need to worry about defining them):
* `enrollmentDate` and `conversionWindowDays` parameters
* `app_use` and `search` metrics

**Example definition**: [native_experiments.json](./tests/test_data/valid/native_experiments.json)

### All other pixels
* All other pixels must be defined in any file within the `pixels` directory and its children
* Each JSON file can contain multiple pixels, keyed by the static portion of the pixel name
    * Add your pixel where it makes the most sense
    * You can use either JSON or JSON5 (JSON with comments, trailing commas) to document your pixels
* Pixel definitions must adhere to the [pixel schema](./schemas/pixel_schema.json5)

Below, you'll find a walkthrough of the schema requirements and options.
As you read through, you can refer to the [pixel_guide.json](./tests/test_data/valid/pixels/pixel_guide.json5) for examples.

#### Minimum requirements
Each pixel **must** contain the following properties:
* `description` - when the pixel fires and its purpose
* `owners` - DDG usernames of who to contact about the pixel
* `triggers` - one or more of the [possible triggers](./schemas/pixel_schema.json5#27) that apply to the pixel

#### Pixels with dynamic names
If the pixel name is parameterized, you can utilize the `suffixes` property.

Required properties for each suffix:
* `description`

Optional properties for each suffix:
* `key` - static portion of the suffix
* JSON schema types - used to indicate constrained values for the suffix. Can be anything from https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type

Note:
* You can utilize a 'shortcut' to point to a common suffix that's predefined in `suffixes_dictionary.json`
  * See `device_type` in [pixel_guide.json](./tests/test_data/valid/pixels/pixel_guide.json5)
  and [suffixes_dictionary.json](./tests/test_data/valid/suffixes_dictionary.json)
* Ordering of suffixes matters

#### Pixels with parameters
If the pixel contains parameters, you can utilize the `parameters` property.

Required properties for each parameter:
* `key` - parameter key
  * As an alternative, you can use `keyPattern` to define dynamic parameter keys.
  Note that such cases are unusual and should be avoided if possible.
* `description`

Optional properties for each parameter:
* JSON schema types - used to indicate constrained parameter values. Can be anything from https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type

* You can utilize a 'shortcut' to point to a common parameter that's predefined in `params_dictionary.json`
  * See `appVersion` in [pixel_guide.json](./tests/test_data/valid/pixels/pixel_guide.json5)
  and [params_dictionary.json](./tests/test_data/valid/params_dictionary.json)
* Ordering of suffixes matters

#### Temporary pixels
If the pixel is temporary, set an expiration date in the `expires` property.

## Validation
**Background**:
* Validation ensures that pixel definitions conform to the [schema](./schemas/pixel_schema.json5) and follow a consistent format.
* Validation will run as part of CI, but you can also run it manually - details below.
* A repository that supports pixel definitions will have a folder setup with `package.json` pointing to this module, referred to as `PackageFolder` below. 
    * Note: usually `PackageFolder` is the same as the `RepoSpecificPixelFolder` referenced in the previous section.

**Pre-requisites**:
* Install Node.js: see instructions in https://nodejs.org/en/download
* Install dependencies:
    ```
    $ cd ${PackageFolder}
    $ npm i
    ```

**Running validation**:
```
$ cd ${PackageFolder}
$ npm run validate-defs
```
Note:
* If formatting errors are found, you can fix them with `npm run lint.fix`
* For schema validation failures, check the output and apply fixes manually
* You can also (re)validate a single file: 
    * Schema validation: `npx validate-ddg-pixel-defs . -f ${path to file relative to PackageFolder/pixels/ directory}`
    * Formatting: `npx prettier ${path to file relative to PackageFolder/ directory} --check`
